# WDI Jeopardy

This project demonstrates simple DOM manipulation, user interaction handling, and storing/retrieving data from a object library.

## Project Description

This is a two player game that toggles between players when a question has been answered incorrectly. The game keeps track of the user's score and name and determines a winner once all the questions have been answered.

### User Stories

* User is introduced to the game and told to enter their name.
* User chooses a card of any category or value.
* User is forced to choose 1 of 3 possible correct answers.
    * Question value is added to player's score if correct.
    * Question value is deducted from player's score in incorrect.
    * If question is answered incorrectly then player two become the current player.
* Once all questions have been answered the winner (Or lack of winner) will be displayed.
* Users have the ability to reset the game at any point.
